This is a test.

Getting into the Enterprise market will always be hard. But by reducing the
technology burden, Replicated plans to erase much of the pain so you can focus
on the other human-centric tasks. Not only am I an investor in Replicated, I
believe in their mission and their founders so much that I've joined as an
advisor. I understand what the uphill slog of the SaaS to Enterprise climb feels
like, and I'm going to do my best to ensure you don't have to suffer it as much
as I did.

I'm also pleased to announce that Travis CI is now shipping their Enterprise
product using Replicated. To see what the installation process is like, [watch
Grant install Travis CI
Enterprise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViN-qkcovL0&feature=youtu.be) on a
fresh server in about seven minutes. For a deeper dive, Travis CI has also
published a blog post covering some of their process in [getting their
Enterprise installer ready using
Replicated](http://blog.travis-ci.com/2015-06-19-how-we-improved-travis-ci-installation/).

In the coming weeks, you'll start to see other well-known startups launching (or
re-launching) Enterprise versions of their SaaS software on top of Replicated.
If you're looking to do the same, and want to save yourself a lot of heartache,
email [contact@replicated.com](mailto:contact@replicated.com), and start
focusing on what matters the most: your unique and kickass product.
