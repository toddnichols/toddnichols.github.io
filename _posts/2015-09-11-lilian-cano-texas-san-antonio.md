## Overview

The current course curriculum follows the intermediate course guidelines, with a strong emphasis on grammar, vocabulary usage, and writing. The course concentrates on the subjunctive, being the third semester course, it is very common for the students to be focusing on this area. The book also has a web component, where students work outside of class time to practice the material they have learned. The web component includes grammar exercises, listening comprehension and videos. In this course, the students also have culture quizzes, short film quizzes, a culture presentation, essays, two speaking videos and a speaking exam at the end of the semester. The current course curriculum has many strengths, starting with the grammar acquisition and the strong emphasis on the writing. The weakness in this course, is once again, the speaking part. There isn't enough time to practice the speaking during class, and outside of class this task is very hard to accomplish and grade.

## TalkAbroad Implementation

The students will have 4 conversations total throughout the semester. ( 1 conversation per chapter, except the last chapter). They will talk about the material we will cover in that chapter:

* Personal relationships, friendship, love, stages of life, weddings, feelings.
* Culture, movies, television shows, music, art.
* Body parts, sickness, going to the doctor, the pharmacy.
* World news, getting a job, job interviews, businesses, etc

The students prepare questions ahead of time to ask their conversation partner, and they will be using these questions to guide the conversation. At the end of the semester, they will have a final project to present. Each student will speak in front of the class and talk in Spanish about everything they learned from their conversation partners. They will give a presentation based on their conversations, and tell the rest of the class how they do certain things in their country or countries (using the material from chapters 11-14).
