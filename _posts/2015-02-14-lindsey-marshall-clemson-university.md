I am currently enrolled in Spanish 201 and completed a TalkAbroad conversation with Margarita Atuesta who was from Colombia, South America. She is a professor and is married with three children. Before the conversation, I was very nervous because I am not very good at speaking Spanish so I thought it was going to be very difficult. While it was a challenging experience, it was a very good one as well. I learned a lot about the culture and style of living in Colombia. I actually had a very good connection with Margarita and had some similar interests, which also made the conversation more enjoyable. We talked about the Bible which is a big part of my life and shared some of our favorite Bible verses. Overall, it was a very good.
