Check out the new <a href="https://resources.talkabroad.com/best_practices/">Best Practices</a> section on our Resources page! Weâ€™ve put together guidelines to help you create successful assignments, so you and your students can have a positive TalkAbroad experience. Our guidelines give you keys to creating successful assignments, as well as characteristics that make an assignment likely to be unsuccessful. We also include concrete examples of good and bad assignments and information about how TalkAbroad trains its conversation partners. We hope these will be useful tools for you when developing your curriculum and writing classroom assignments!
