# When creating assignments remember how TalkAbroad conversation partners are trained:

### Conversational Skills:
- Conversation partners aim for 50/50 or 60/40 listening-to-speaking ratios.
- Conversation partners ask and answer questions to encourage and engage the student providing a conversation that flows naturally, rather than a conversation that starts and stops to correct grammar or pronunciation.

### Engagement with the Assignment:
- Conversation partners are knowledgeable about the assignment and work to stay on topic as much as possible.
- Conversation partners do not bring up topics of religion, sex or politics without being prompted by the student or assignment topic. 

### Adaptation to the Level of the Student:
- Conversation partners communicate only in the target language.
- Conversation partners adjust speed and articulation to the level of the student.
- Conversation partners use and encourage students to use circumlocution to negotiate meaning.
