One frequently requested feature by professors over the years has been conversation of a shorter duration. After a successful beta run with approximately 15 schools this past Spring, we are pleased to announce the release of 10-minute conversations starting in Fall of 2018.

## Usage

10-minute conversations are specifically created for novice-level students on the ACTFL proficiency scale. 10-minute convesations are extremely short, and intermediate level students found the experience significantly less rewarding than the standard 30-minute conversations. At most, students can complete basic introductions and 2-3 can-do statements.

During curriculum planning, professors can combine any number of 10-minute and 30-minute conversations. We are seeing patterns emerge with 10-minute conversation usage:
 * 101 courses: 4 10-minute conversations
 * 102 courses: 1 10-minute conversation and 2 30-minute conversations
 * 200-level courses: 2-5 30-minute conversations
 * 300-level coruses: 5-7 30-minute conversations

## Pricing 

10-minute conversations cost $7.50 each, with a minimum purchase of 4. The minimum purchase is waived with the purchase of 30-minute conversations. If you would like to discuss implementing 10-minute conversations in your curriculum please send us an email at sales@talkabroad.com.
