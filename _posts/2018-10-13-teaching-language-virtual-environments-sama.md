This book sheds new light on language and literature teaching, and offers examples of teaching language in virtual environments. Providing an overview of virtual environments for teaching, it also includes chapters devoted to methodology design for second language teaching in these environments. Further it describes tools for second/ foreign language teaching and proposals for specific second language teaching in virtual environments. Lastly, it presents experiments on literature teaching in virtual environments and discusses the future of technology in education. With interdisciplinary appeal, the book is a particularly valuable resource for scholars with an interest in technology, language teaching and literature teaching.

Chapters four and eight look specifically at TalkAbroad.
