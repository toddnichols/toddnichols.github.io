Not a problem. Schedule a conversation with a member of our team or simply explore hundreds of student stories on our [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqnE1rQWlIv99-dO4yjnAtA/).

Take some time exploring the free TalkAbroad Sequences created by our team. TalkAbroad Sequences are fully designed 15 or 30-minute TalkAbroad conversations accompanied by preparation and reflection assignments to make implementation a snap and to ensure your students are successful during their conversation.
