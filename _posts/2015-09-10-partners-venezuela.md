# Spanish Convesation Parteners Added in Venezuela

10 Sep 2015

We are thrilled to announce the opening of a new group of conversation partners in Venezuela. Venezuela is an incredibly diverse country with a rich history. We expect students to find a world of different topics to discuss with our Venezuelan partners, ranging from politics to culture.

Our partners are based in Maracaibo. Enjoy!
