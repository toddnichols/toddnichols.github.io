## Overview

Spanish phonetics is the required linguistics course for Spanish majors at Bradley University. Most students will have also taken the conversation course and feel comfortable speaking Spanish. Currently the Spanish Phonetics course focuses on introducing the principles of phonetics while incorporating frequent practice and corrective exercises for oral communication in Spanish. There is a special focus on the differences between Spanish and English pronunciation and how these differences translate to troublesome or hard to pronounce sounds in Spanish. A portion of each class period is dedicated to learning about the sound system in Spanish while the majority of class time is spent putting those ideas into practice through oral repetition and a variety of exercises geared towards getting students to speak and apply what they have just learned.

Unfortunately the limited amount of time practicing these skills in class is just not enough. The application of the phonetic knowledge gained in class is currently tested through a final oral exam where an assigned paragraph that students should have practiced and perfected is read at the end of the semester. This has worked well as a stand-alone assessment, but could be enhanced by having students read the same paragraph several times in the semester to analyze their own improvement. While there are some homework assignments, the main source of practice outside of class is through the ‘prácticas de oído,’ where students provide a written transcription of an oral text (typically a video) to enhance their listening comprehension and familiarization with the sounds of Spanish. Although this is a useful exercise from an instructor’s point of view, students in the past have complained that it is very difficult and one can speculate that they do not realize the language skills that they are practicing.

## TalkAbroad Implementation

The modified curriculum will change the listening practice (prácticas de oído) to a more interactive experience for the students that will involve conversations with native speakers about topics that they choose. Through these conversations, students will practice both their listening and speaking skills in Spanish and this will give them a more vested interest in the experience. Furthermore, this type of practice is more beneficial as it is a real life experience, the kind of experience that could actually occur when they encounter a native speaker. Thus, it will be easier for students to understand the value and the benefits that they will gain from the assignments. 

As part of the project requirements, students will translate a portion of the conversation using Spanish orthography and will then analyze specific dialect features or regional characteristics that the speaker uses. This analysis will encourage students to demonstrate their kinowledge of the phonetic characteristics of the language that are discussed and practiced in class. A final component of the assignment will be to assess their own pronunciation and grammar mistakes, an analysis which will lead to improvement through recognition of the individual errors they tend to make. This modified assignment will increase the amount of improvement in pronunciation that students see throughout the semester by providing additional speaking opportunities outside of class.

Students will be required to complete at least three conversations in the semester, and they will have the option of additional conversation practice.

## Results

The new curriculum has been well received. Students appreciate the additional oral practice, and especially enjoy the opportunity to use their new skills with native speakers. However, the biggest obstacle for future implementation of the same curriculum is lack of additional funding for the TalkAbroad program. While the students benefitted from the free conversations with native speakers through the use of the curriculum grant, in their end of semester survey regarding the experience nearly all of them expressed that they would be hesitant to pay for this kind of program in the future and would be upset if it were included as a “course fee.” Without funding to support the inclusion of the TalkAbroad conversations, unfortunately they cannot be included in future semesters. One solution to this obstacle would be to look for external grant money that could be used to fund the inclusion of TalkAbroad.

I have shared the results of this change in curriculum with the faculty in my department and expressed the benefits of including conversations with native speakers in varying levels of language classes. I also plan to write an abstract to share my results with the foreign language teaching community at the next ACTFL conference. If I am able to include TalkAbroad in an additional semester of Spanish Phonetics, I should have enough comparison data to write an abstract to present my findings alongside other linguists and educators at the Current Approaches to Spanish and Portuguese Second Language Phonology conference in 2018.
Overall the new curriculum for Spanish Phonetics has been a success. Although I am currently teaching the same course this semester without the inclusion of the TalkAbroad conversation component, I hope to find additional funding to be able to use TalkAbroad next year when I teach the course again.
