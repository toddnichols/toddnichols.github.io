 I am currently in a class involving the discussion of Hispanics and healthcare. For my assignment, I had to talk about the healthcare system in the United States and compare it to the healthcare system in Peru by speaking with my partner, Shirley. She was very patient and spoke at a pace where I could comprehend what she was saying, as well as respond! She was very knowledgeable about our topic of conversation, so it flowed smoothly and there was always something to say or ask. Consequently, the allotted time for the conversation went by very quickly. Before the conversation, I was very nervous of running out of things to say during the time period, but afterward I realized how easy it was to hold the conversation, especially because Shirley was so interested in what I had to say and asked me some very thought provoking questions as well! One funny thing was that Shirley lives right next to an airport and a plane flew over during our conversation and I have train tracks in my backyard and a train came by as well! Overall though, this experience was such a beneficial way to practice with my speaking skills, as well as discuss relevant information!
