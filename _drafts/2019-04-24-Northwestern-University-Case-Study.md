## Northwestern University Case Study - Lessons Learned
## Intermediate German
## Winter 2018/2019
*prepared by the coordinator of the Intermediate program at NU, Martina Kerlova*

This report covers our experience incorporating TalkAbroad conversations for the first time into the Intermediate German Curriculum at Northwestern University in winter 2018. The college operates on a quarter system and each of the quarters is thematically and grammatically structured. Our students had four quarters of German studies before they participated in the conversations via TalkAbroad.

In addition to studying grammar, our students worked with 20th century historical and literary materials (a play by Bert Brecht, literary story from the 50’s about the former Western Germany by H. Böll and a movie about everyday life in the East Germany). In the winter 2018 quarter, we worked with contemporary popular German culture. The topics from fall quarter proved less suitable for a spontaneous conversation than popular culture. Music and politics were best received, though politics presented a struggle for some students and/or their partners.

The first trial run was fairly intensive: five conversations for each student, at the end of each unit to practice topics and vocabulary covered in the respective units, more or less independently, as an additional supplemental boost.
 
Fifty-nine Intermediate German students at Northwestern completed five conversations with minor issues with scheduling and occasional technical problems. The technical side was mainly a smooth experience, from the scheduling mode to retrieving results. Students reported occasionally problems with seeing or hearing their partner, but this was, to my knowledge, usually remedied by TalkAbroad in offering another conversation for no charge. This solution certainly worked for the instructors, but the students responded less enthusiastically simply because it meant another time commitment.
 
With high frequency, the topics originally planned for each conversation turned out to be rather irrelevant or at least complicating matters. In barely two weeks (which is one unit in a quarter system, for a total of four units in the quarter), students at the intermediate level had not had sufficient time to prepare for a topic-centered conversation. Only our strongest students would prefer a theme in 2019. We opened up the assignments to a general chat to relieve the tension. 

# 2018 vision:
- We would integrate the conversations into the current existing curriculum as a supportive, supplementary tool. 
- The topics for each unit would be congruent with the topics for conversations.
- Students would work with the vocabulary from current chapters.

# The unexpected:
- Introducing TalkAbroad wasn’t met with overwhelming enthusiasm.
- About a fifth of the students would turn off the camera. 
- Some students were finishing early, running out of vocabulary and topics.
- Using TalkAbroad at the intermediate level as an enhancing side track didn’t prove very efficient without taking the time out of the existing curriculum to actually prepare the students for every conversation. 

# Student reflections:
- Our students respected their partners in Germany and commented unanimously on their openness, positive attitude, patience and “awesomeness.”
- It’s either love or hate. It seems that very few students settled somewhere in between. Many students described their conversations as awkward.
- Students expect perfection from technology, so they always commented on any, even minor audio issues. The lack of patience was striking.

# 2019 Version:
- Talk Abroad assignments were heavily structured. The structured conversations worked better, but it took us away from the spontaneity and also carved out time from the new material to be presented in class. On the other hand, it got us closer to the original goal - it boosted motivation, satisfaction, confidence for most students.
- If the existing curriculum is packed with required material, as it is in a college-level quarter system, it might not be easy to Integrate TalkAbroad as an enhancement. At the intermediate level, we still have to spend the majority of the time preparing the ground before we throw them into an unscripted conversation. For this reason, TalkAbroad might work best in conversational classes or more advanced, topic centered classes. But most colleges have a two-year language requirement, if any, and therefore we will continue to explore ways how to immerse our students culturally as early as we can.
- Political themes are unavoidable. That could serve as both a negative or a positive, and it should be expected and integrated into a post-conversational session. It’s an excellent stimulus and a conversation starter.

# Strategies for future:
If TalkAbroad is used at the intermediate level, it needs to be a focal point of at least one unit. For programs using it for the first time, some training might be helpful, guidance e.g. as such:
- Collect topics together with your students that they’d be comfortable discussing.
- Collect expectations. Share anxieties in class in German. 
- Brainstorm together in class what questions the partners could possibly ask and help everyone prepare questions for the partner.
- Work with the profiles the partners in Germany have posted. Study German topography and geography.
- Have your students submit written feedback about both their emotional experience and their own “performance.” Don’t grade the actual conversation, only the follow-up work.
- Have students listen to the conversations – their own and their classmates and come up with strategies for their next conversation. This also could be done as a peer-editing exercise where students listen also to their partner’s conversation and give suggestions.
- Build up the expectations that TalkAbroad is a highlight of the course.
- Shift focus from “ich” to the content of the conversation: collect cultural information, facts that we learned from the partners - to reduce anxiety.
- Select an American cultural topic and have students collect their partner’s opinion to raise awareness of other ways to think and live: e.g. showering in the evening or in the morning; the place of a public library in the educational system; student life; sweatpants; the place of national anthem in the cultural awareness and identity, etc.
- Select a German cultural topic and collect opinions: e.g. Germans at the dinner table; Germans and their media; Germans using medicine.

## In Closing
Using TalkAbroad has been a much more positive experience in 2019, easy for instructors and enthusiastically received by most students. It came at the cost of the existing curricula, which needed to be adapted. In a strong and a rigorous program with three or four levels, it might be easier to use TalkAbroad after the students covered some basic vocabulary and reach a level of at least 4-5,000 words. If this isn’t possible, the space needs to be carved out, or else it’s not as effective. Also, we may speculate that adult students are more self-aware and reluctant to engage in a real conversation with a real partner than middle or high school students.

I have presented about the Northwestern experience at the 2018 ACTFL conference and at Northwestern to the language community. Despite a rocky beginning in 2018, we are looking forward to collaborating with TalkAbroad in the future.
